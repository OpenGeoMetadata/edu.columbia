  "dc_description_s": "This map layer portrays 1993 to 2001 estimates for total personal income, per capita personal income, annual number of full-time and part-time jobs, average wage per job in dollars, population, and per capita number of jobs, for counties in the United States.  \n\nTotal personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area.  It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance.  \n\nPer capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation.  \n\nThe average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners.  The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included.  Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included.\n      \nAverage wage per job is the total wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county.  Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses;and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants.  It reflects the amount of payments disbursed,but not necessarily earned during the year.\n\nPer capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation.  \n\nAll dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.The information in this map layer comes from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS) that is distributed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov/.\n\nThis is an updated version of the November 2004 map layer.",
