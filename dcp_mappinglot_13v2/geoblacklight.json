They have been added and maintained by DCP for cartographic purpose. There are three kinds of  Mapping Lots: street center 'malls' which are small road-divider type blocks separating lanes of traffic on certain streets; Traffic islands which are small traffic lane separators or pedestrian rest stop blocks other than malls (usually at intersections);  streets through parks which are streets existing physically in parks but are not part of the Tax Map.",
