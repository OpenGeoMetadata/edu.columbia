  "dc_description_s": "\n  Europe Historical Precipitation, Winter 1673 is a raster theme providing a precipitation estimate for Europe in the Winter of that year. The resolution is 0.5 degrees. This is part of the Europe Historical Seasonal Precipitation Reconstruction Collection which provides estimates for each season from 1500 to 2000. The methodology used in the creation of the estimate is detailed in the 2005 paper \"Five Hundred Years of Gridded High-Resolution Precipitation Reconstructions over Europe and the Connection to Large-Scale Circulation\" by Andreas Pauling, JÃ¼rg Luterbacher, Carlo Casty, and Heinz Wanner (DOI 10.1007/s00382-005-0090-8). Files were converted to TIFF format by Columnbia Libraries staff.\n",
