The resolution is 3 arc seconds (90 meters). The pixel value represents the elevation in meters.\n\nThe version of the SRTM 3-arc-second data that served as the basis for the SRTM Global Digital Elevation Model data is the Version 2 \"Finished\" data in DTED Level 1 format that was created by NGA by subsampling SRTM 1-arc-second data.",
