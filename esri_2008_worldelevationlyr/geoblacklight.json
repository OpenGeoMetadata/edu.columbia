This dataset is comprised of data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) between latitudes 60 degrees North and 56 degrees South at a resolution of 3 arc seconds (90 meters).  The remaining polar regions are comprised of data from the Global Digital Elevation Model (GTOPO30) at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (+- 1 Km).  In total this dataset is comprised of 12 tiles that have been merged into a raster catalog.",
