Water Bodies (On Campus Access Only) is an ESRI .lyr file referencing a polygon theme representing lakes, rivers, and ocean areas of the world. The dataset is comprised of 12 tiles; 6 of the tiles were originally produced as a companion to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model.  The extent of these 6 tiles cover the SRTM coverage area (between 60 degrees North and 56 degrees South latitude) and their primary source for was a Landsat 5-based landcover water layer supplemented with medium-scale maps and charts.  The more northerly and southerly latitudes were derived from the GTOPO30 DEM at a resolution of 1 kilometer.",
