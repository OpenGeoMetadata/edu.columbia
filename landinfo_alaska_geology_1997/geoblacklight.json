  "dc_description_s": "Alaska Geologic Formations is a polygon theme representing geologic formations throughout Alaska.  This dataset consists of a polygon coverage and associated attribute data derived from the 1980 Geologic Map of Alaska compiled by H.M.  Beikman and published by the US Geological Survey.  The map is a regional summary of geologic formations and units that can be shown cartographically at 1:2,500,000.  This digital dataset includes all (184) map units from the original map.  182 are geologic units; the others are polygons for large glaciers and lakes. This coverage is not intended to be a complete representation of the printed geologic map.  It does NOT include the following features:  faults, locations of volcanoes or volcanic vents, the map explanation, correlation charts or description of map units.",
