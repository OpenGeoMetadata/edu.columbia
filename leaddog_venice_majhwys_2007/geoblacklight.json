  "dc_description_s": "Venice Major Highways is a line theme representing highways in Venice, Italy.  The Major Highways layer contains Road Network features based on the \"Functional Class\" value on each link present in NAVSTREETS. This layer contains all links that have a Functional Class value of either \"Level 1\" or \"Level 2\". The Functional Class of a highway defines the network used to determine a logical and efficient route for a traveler.\n\nFunctional Class Level 1 roads are those with very few (if any), speed changes, typically controlled access, and provide high volume, maximum speed movement between and through major metropolitan areas.  Functional Class Level 2 roads are those with very few (if any), speed changes, and provide high volume, high speed traffic movement. They are typically used to channel traffic to (and from) Level 1 roads.",
