This is a public dataset for the Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  The public database consists of four tables. One of the tables is a spatial table: INTERMODAL_FACILITY.  The three other tables consist of attribute data for the database: INTERMODAL_CARGO, INTERMODAL_COMMODITY and INTERMODAL_DIRECTIONALITY.  This database was based on the requirements from the Commodity Flow Survey and with the different modes of DOT, supervised by RITA/BTS.  The database will extend its design to support all of the modes within the DOT and in reference to modes involved with Intermodal transfer.",
