  "dc_description_s": "National Bridge Inventory is a point theme representing bridges in the United States.\n\nThe NBI is a collection of information (database) covering the more than 600,000 bridges located on public roads, including Interstate Highways, U.S. highways, State and county roads, as well as publicly-accessible bridges on Federal lands. It presents a State by State summary analysis of the number, location, and general condition of highway bridges within each State.\n\nAlthough the inventory contains locational information, it's accuracy is unverified, and in many cases the information is not provided or incorrect.  Using information from the inventory, an attempt was made to conflate the bridges to a common reference network, TeleAtlas's DynaMap for Transportation.  Over 75% of the inventory was successfully conflated.  the remaining bridges are included in this shapefile, but are located at longitude-latitude 0-0.",
