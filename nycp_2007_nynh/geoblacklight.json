Neighborhoods are subdivisions of Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). PUMAs were developed for use with the Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) and are approximations of Community Districts. Neighborhoods were created by the New York City Department of City Planning using whole census tracts as building blocks and were not permitted to cross PUMA boundaries.",
