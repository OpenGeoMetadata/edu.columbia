  "dc_description_s": "\nNew York City NYPD Complaint Data, July-December 2008 is a point theme representing each complaint call that NYPD has received in the second half of the year 2008. This dataset was derived from NYC OpenData (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) in July 2019. Each record represents a criminal complaint in NYC and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to victim and suspect demographics is also included. Columbia Libraries staff extracted each half year's records and converted them to shapefile format by state plane x/y coordinates. Some records lack geolocation information, and they have coordinates 0,0. Columbia Libraries staff has also manipulated the column names to fit them with shapefile format, and a codebook and a has been included in the download package. A penal law codebook provided by NYC OpenData is also included.\n",
